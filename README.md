Coding assessment

For this assignment I have created a combined rules dictionary which will pre-compute rules and combine into a condensed
representation after reading the csv file. I have created a list of single valued Ips. This is done to reduce the number
of computations.Function accept_packet is created for accepting request based on rules and displaying the output.

I created a sample csv file for performing tests on my code.
I have used the logic of Hashmap for reducing the number of computations and hence improving the efficiency of my code.

I am interested in the Policy team as well as the Data team but my preference is for the Policy team.
